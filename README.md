In this Project, we are going to predict whether a person's annual income is more than $50K or below $50K using various features like age, education, workclass, country, occupation etc. And this is a binary classification problem. The dataset we are going to use is the Adult census income dataset from Kaggle which contains about 32561 rows and 15 features.
